''' The road transport corporation (RTC) of a city wants to know whether a particular bus-route is running on profit or loss.
Assume that the following information are given:
Price per litre of fuel = 70
Mileage of the bus in km/litre of fuel = 10
Price(Rs) per ticket = 80
The bus runs on multiple routes having different distance in kms and number of passengers.
Write a function to calculate and return the profit earned (Rs) in each route. Return -1 in case of loss '''

def calculate(distance,total_passengers):
    cost = 70 * distance/10
    tickets_sold = total_passengers * 80 
    if cost <= tickets_sold :
        return abs(cost - tickets_sold)
    else :
        return -1

distance=int(input("Enter the total distance travelled in kms: "))
total_passengers=int(input("Enter the no. of Passengers: "))
print("Total profit earned is : ",calculate(distance,total_passengers))
