'''An organization has decided to provide salary hike to its employees based on their job level. Employees can be in job levels 3 , 4 or 5.

In case of invalid job level, consider hike percentage to be 0.

Given the current salary and job level, write a python program to find and display the new salary of an employee. Identify the test data and use it to test the program.'''
